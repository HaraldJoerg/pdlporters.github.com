How to maintain MANIFEST.SKIP
-----------------------------

MANIFEST.SKIP is used to specify files which should *not* be included
with the published web pages.  In MANIFEST.SKIP use the same regular
expressions that you use with normal Perl dists (for a good reason the
syntax is the same: we shamelessly ripped of internal code from
ExtUtils::Manifest to implement the file exclusion code).

If you are not sure if you need to add more exclusions to
MANIFEST.SKIP run

  make dist

and inspect the files .dirs and .mirror that will be generated for
anything that shouldn't be there (i.e. non-html, non-image).

To check if you accidentally excluded something that is actually
required for the web pages, you will have to publish the web page
distribution.  This can be done by making the dist (make dist) and
unpacking it into a folder of you choice:

  mkdir myfolder
  (cd myfolder; tar zxf ../pdlwww.tar.gz)

and point you favorite browser at this local copy.  Then check for any
problems.  Bear in mind that the pages make use of Server-Side
Includes (<!--#include--> and <!--#flastmod--> statements in the
.shtml files) as well as rely on absolute path names, so things might
not look quite right.  This is the price of having a simple (i.e.,
non-existent) build process.

How to publish these pages
--------------------------

1) build the web page archive

  make dist

2) copy to SF

  scp pdlwww.tar.gz your_user_id@shell.sourceforge.net:.

3) login to shell server at SF

  ssh your_user_id@shell.sourceforge.net

4) Make a backup copy of the current pages

  cd /home/groups/p/pd/pdl/htdocs
  rm -rf WWWold
  mkdir WWWold
  cp --parents `cat .mirror` WWWold

5) install files into the SF web area

  tar zxf ~/pdlwww.tar.gz

Now an *important* step to let other developers
publish, too. Make everything group writable:

 chmod -R g+w .

If you run into permission problems
please ask for help on the mailing list.

5) check out pages which should now be online at

  http://pdl.sourceforge.net/

If you made a mistake, you can edit the files directly here, and the
changes will be visible immediately.  Just remember to propagate that
change back to the copy on your machine so you can commit it to CVS.
Be aware that these files are mirrored to pdl.perl.org shortly after
midnight Hawaii Standard Time (GMT - 10 hours), so if you leave any
mistakes here they WILL make their way to the main PDL website.
