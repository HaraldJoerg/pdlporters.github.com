How to maintain MANIFEST.SKIP
-----------------------------

MANIFEST.SKIP is used to speficy files
which should *not* be included with
the published web pages. For example, all
.wml will be excluded and anything else
that is not part of the actual published
should be similarly specified. In MANIFEST.SKIP
use the same regular expressions that you use
with normal Perl dists (for a good reason the
syntax is the same: we shamelessly ripped of
internal code from ExtUtils::Manifest to implement
the file exclusion code).

If you are not sure if you need to add more exclusions
to MANIFEST.SKIP run

  make dist

and inspect the file .mirror that will be generated for
anything that shouldn't be there (i.e. non-html, non-image).

To check if you accidentally excluded something
that is actually required for the web pages, you
will have to publish the web page distribution.
This can be done by making the dist (make dist)
and unpacking it into a folder of you choice:

  mkdir myfolder
  (cd myfolder; tar zxf ../pdlwww.tar.gz)

and point you favorite browser at this local copy.
Then check for any problems.

How to publish these pages
--------------------------

1) build the web page archive

  make dist

2) copy to SF

  scp pdlwww.tar.gz your_user_id@shell.sourceforge.net:.

3) login to shell server at SF

  ssh your_user_id@shell.sourceforge.net

4) install files into testing arena

  cd /home/groups/p/pd/pdl/htdocs
  mv WWWbeta WWWbeta_old
  mkdir WWWbeta
  cd WWWbeta
  tar zxf ~/pdlwww.tar.gz

Now an *important* step to let other developers
publish, too. Make everything group writable:

 chmod -R g+w WWWbeta

If you run into permission problems
please ask for help on the mailing list.

5) check out pages which should now be online at

  http://pdl.sourceforge.net/WWWbeta/

6) publish web pages

If you have not yet checked out the sourceforge utility
scripts, do it now:
	 
  cd
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs:/cvsroot/pdl co sfscripts

Now you should have a number of scripts in the directory sfscripts.
If you already checked these out in the past, you still might
want to check for updates:

  (cd sfscripts; cvs update)

Now you are ready to actually publish the pages:

  chmod +x sfscripts/wwwpublish
  sfscripts/wwwpublish

7) page should now be online at

  http://pdl.sourceforge.net/WWW/

and will be automatically mirrored to

  pdl.perl.org

(not sure about the interval right now, it might
 take up to a day)
