This is still an early version of the PDL FAQ. As such it is almost
certainly incomplete and maybe unclear in parts. You are explicitly
encouraged to let us know about questions which you think should be
answered in this document but currently aren't. Similarly, if you think
parts of this document are unclear, please tell us about it.


<P>

Send your comments, additions, suggestions or corrections to the PDL
mailing list at <EM>perldl@jach.hawaii.edu</EM> (preferably) or to the FAQ maintainer Christian Soeller (<EM>csoelle@sghms.ac.uk</EM>). See below for instructions on how to join the mailing lists.

<H2><A NAME="What_is_PDL_">What is PDL ?

</A></H2>
PDL stands for Perl Data Language. To say it with the words of Karl
Glazebrook, initiator of the PDL project:


<P>

<PRE>   The PDL concept is to give standard perl5 the ability
   to COMPACTLY store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large
   N-dimensional data sets which are the bread and butter
   of scientific computing. e.g. $a=$b+$c can add two
   2048x2048 images in only a fraction of a second.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>   It is hoped to eventually provide tons of useful
   functionality for scientific and numeric analysis.
</PRE>

<P>

For readers familiar with other scientific data evaluation packages it may
be helpful to add that PDL is in many respects similar to IDL, MATLAB and
similar packages. However, it tries to improve on a number of issues which
were perceived (by the authors of PDL) as shortcomings of those existing
packages.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="B_Who_supports_PDL_Who_dev"><STRONG>[+]</STRONG> Who supports PDL? Who develops it?

</A></H2>
PDL is supported by its users. General informal support for PDL is provided
through the PDL mailing list (<EM>perldl@jach.hawaii.edu</EM>, see below).


<P>

As a Perl extension (see below) it is devoted to the idea of free and open
development put forth by the Perl community. PDL was and is being actively
developed by a loosely knit group of people around the world who coordinate
their activities through the PDL development mailing list (<EM>pdl-porters@jach.hawaii.edu</EM>, see below). If you would like to join in the ongoing efforts to improve
PDL please join this list.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Why_yet_another_Data_Language_">Why yet another Data Language ?

</A></H2>
There are actually several reasons and everyone should decide for himself
which are the most important ones:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
PDL is ``free software''. The authors of PDL think that this concept has
several advantages: everyone has access to the sources -&gt; better
debugging, easily adaptable to your own needs, extensible for your
purposes, etc...


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
PDL is based on a powerful and well designed scripting language: Perl. In
contrast to other scientific/numeric data analysis languages it has been
designed using the language features of a proven language instead of having
grown into existence from scratch defining the control structures while
features were added during development (leading to languages that often
appear clumsy and badly planned for most existing packages with similar
scope as PDL).


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Using Perl as the basis a PDL programmer has all the powerful features of
Perl at his hand, right from the start. This includes regular expressions,
associative arrays (hashes), well designed interfaces to the operating
system, network, etc. Experience has shown that even in mainly numerically
oriented programming it is often extremely handy if you have easy access to
powerful semi-numerical or completely non-numerical functionality as well.
For example, you might want to offer the results of a complicated
computation as a server process to other processes on the network, perhaps
directly accepting input from other processes on the network. Using Perl
and existing Perl extension packages things like this are no problem at all
(and it all will fit into your ``PDL script'').


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Extremely easy extensibility and interoperability as PDL is a Perl
extension; development support for Perl extensions is an integral part of
Perl and there are already numerous extensions to standard Perl freely
available on the network.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Integral language features of Perl (regular expressions, hashes, object
modules) immensely facilitated development and implementation of key
concepts of PDL. One of the most striking examples for this point is
probably PDL::PP (see below), a code generator/parser/pre-processor that
generates PDL functions from concise descriptions.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
None of the existing DLs follow the Perl language rules, which the authors
firmly believe in:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
TIMTOWTDI: There is more than one way to do it. Minimalist languages are
interesting for computer scientists, but for users, a little bit of
redundancy makes things wildly easier to cope with and allows individual
programming styles - just as people speak in different ways. For many
people this will undoubtedly be a reason to avoid PDL ;)


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Simple things are simple, complicated things possible: Things that are
often done should be easy to do in the language, whereas seldom done things
shouldn't be too cumbersome.


<P>

</UL>
All existing languages violate at least one of these rules.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
As a project for the future PDL should be able to use super computer
features, e.g. vector capabilities/parallel processing. This will probably
be achieved by having PDL::PP (, see below) generate appropriate code on
such architectures to exploit these features.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
[ fill in your personal 111 favourite reasons here...]


<P>

</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_is_PDL_good_for_">What is PDL good for ?

</A></H2>
Just in case you do not yet know what the main features of PDL are and what
one could do with them, here is a (necessarily selective) list of key
features:


<P>

PDL is well suited for matrix computations, general handling of
multidimensional data, image processing, general scientific computation,
numerical applications. It supports I/O for many popular image and data
formats, 1D (line plots), 2D (images) and 3D (volume visualisation, surface
plots via OpenGL/MesaGL) graphics display capabilities and implements lots
of numerical and semi-numerical algorithms.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_is_the_connection_between_P">What is the connection between PDL and Perl ?

</A></H2>
PDL is a Perl5 extension package. As such it needs an existing Perl5
installation (see below) to run. Furthermore, much of PDL is written in
perl (+ some core functionality that is written in C). PDL programs are
(syntactically) just perl scripts that happen to use some of the
functionality implemented by the package ``PDL'';


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_do_I_need_to_run_PDL_on_my_">What do I need to run PDL on my machine ?

</A></H2>
Since PDL is just a Perl package you need first of all an installation of
Perl on your machine. As of this writing PDL requires version 5.004 of
Perl, version 5.004_4 or higher is
<EM>strongly</EM> recommended. More information on where and how to get a Perl installation
can be found at the Perl home page <EM>http://www.perl.com</EM>
and at many CPAN sites (if you do not know what <EM>CPAN</EM> is check the answer to the next question).


<P>

Furthermore, you need the PDL package which will be installed as an
extension within your PERL installation. See below for directions how and
where to get the latest PDL distribution.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Where_do_I_get_it_">Where do I get it?

</A></H2>
PDL is available as source distribution in the
<EM>Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</EM>, or CPAN. This archive contains not only the PDL distribution but also
just about everything else that is Perl-related. CPAN is mirrored by dozens
of sites all over the world. The main site is <EM>ftp://ftp.funet.fi</EM>. You can find a more local CPAN site by getting the file
/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/MIRRORS from
<EM>ftp://ftp.funet.fi</EM>. Alternatively, you can point your Web browser at
<EM>http://www.perl.com</EM> and use its CPAN multiplex service. Within CPAN you find the latest
released version of PDL in the directory CPAN/modules/by-module/PDL/.
Another site that has the latest PDL distribution and the latest beta
versions is
<EM>http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/kgb/perldl</EM>. Thanks to the efforts of Frossie (<EM>frossie@jach.hawaii.edu</EM>) there is now a mirror site in the US at <EM>http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/~frossie/pdl-mirror/</EM>




<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_machines_does_PDL_run_on_t">What machines does PDL run on, then ?

</A></H2>
Ideally, PDL should run on about every machine for which a port of Perl5 is
available that supports Xsubs and the package Extutils::MakeMaker. You also
need a C compiler on your machine to compile those core routines that are
written in C or XS. In practice, you might run into problems if you would
try to compile PDL on some platform it has never been tested on before. A
list of platforms on which PDL has been successfully tested is available at
<EM>http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/kgb/perldl/ports.html</EM>. If you don't have a compiler you can check if a binary distribution for
your platform is available (we haven't yet got round to making binary
versions/bundles available but it is definitely on the TODO list) at the
PDL home site located at <EM>http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/kgb/perldl</EM>.


<P>

If you can (or cannot) get PDL working on a new (previously unsupported)
platform we would like to hear about it. Please, report your
success/failure to the PDL mailing list at
<EM>perldl@jach.hawaii.edu</EM>. We will do our best to assist you in porting PDL to a new system.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_do_I_have_to_pay_to_get_PDL">What do I have to pay to get PDL?

</A></H2>
We are delighted to be able to give you the nicest possible answer on a
question like this: PDL is <CODE>*free</CODE> software* and all sources are
publicly available. But still, there are some copyrights to comply with. So
please, try to be as nice as we (the PDL authors) are and try to comply
with them.


<P>

Oh, before you think it is *completely* free: you have to invest some time
to pull the distribution from the net, compile and install it and (maybe)
read the manuals.


<P>

In the future, we hope to be able to supply bundles/binaries for a number
of popular architectures. However, as of this writing you will have to find
some means of how and where to compile the package yourself.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="B_Where_can_I_get_informati"><STRONG>[+]</STRONG> Where can I get information on PDL?

</A></H2>
The complete PDL documentation is available with the PDL distribution. If
you have PDL installed on your machine and are on a unix like system then
you can read the PDL manuals with the <CODE>man</CODE> command. 
<CODE>man PDL::Intro</CODE> will lead the way to other PDL manual pages. In any case (i.e. also on
non-unixes) <CODE>perldoc PDL::Intro</CODE> should work.


<P>

The easiest way by far, however, to get familiar with PDL is to use the PDL
online help facility from within the <CODE>perldl</CODE> shell. Just type <CODE>perldl</CODE> at your system prompt. Once you are inside the
<CODE>perldl</CODE> shell type <CODE>help</CODE>. Using the <CODE>help</CODE> and <CODE>apropos</CODE>
commands inside the shell you should be able to find the way round the
documentation. Even better, you can immediately try your newly acquired
knowledge about PDL by issuing PDL/perl commands directly at the command
line. To illustrate this process, here is the record of a typical perldl
session of a PDL beginner (lengthy output is only symbolically reproduced
in braces (&lt;... ...&gt;)):


<P>

<PRE>  unix&gt; perldl
  perldl&gt; help
   &lt;.... help output ....&gt;
  perldl&gt; help PDL::Impatient
   &lt;.... man page ....&gt;
  perldl&gt; $a = pdl (1,5,7.3,1.0)
  perldl&gt; $b = sequence float, 4, 4
  perldl&gt; help inner
   &lt;.... help on the 'inner' function ....&gt;
  perldl&gt; $c = inner $a, $b
  perldl&gt; p $c

As of this writing (FAQ version 0.5 of 5.3.98) the latest released version
is 1.11. Currently in beta test is 1.99. The latest versions should always
be available from a CPAN mirror site near you (see above for info on where
to get PDL).


<P>

If there are alpha releases that haven't yet been put onto CPAN interested

If you have a certain project in mind you should check if somebody else is
already working on it or if you could benefit from existing modules. Do so
by posting your planned project to the PDL developers mailing list at <EM>pdl-porters@jach.hawaii.edu</EM>. To subscribe, send a message to <EM>pdl-porters-request@jach.hawaii.edu</EM>
containing a string in the following format:


<P>

<PRE>  subscribe me@my.email.address
</PRE>

<P>

where you should replace the string <EM>me@my.email.address</EM> with your email address. You can also read past and current mails in the
searchable hypertext version of the mailing list at <EM>http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/pdl-porters/</EM>. We are always looking for people to write code and/or documentation ;).

</A></H2>
First, make sure that the bug/problem you came across has not already been
dealt with somewhere else in this FAQ. Secondly, you can check the
searchable archive of the PDL mailing list at whether this bug has already
been discussed. If you still haven't found any explanations you can post a
bug report to <EM>perldl@jach.hawaii.edu</EM>.

</A></H2>
First make sure you have read the file INSTALL in the distribution. In
particular, check the file perldl.conf to see if by editing the
configuration options in that file you will be able to successfully build
PDL. Some of the modules need additional software installed, please refer
to the file DEPENDENCIES for further details.


<P>

If you would like to save an edited perldl.conf for future builds just copy
it as ~/.perldl.conf into your home directory where it will be picked up
automatically during the PDL build process.


<P>

If you still can't make it work properly please submit a bug report
including detailed information on the problems you encountered to the
perldl mailing list (<EM>perldl@jach.hawaii.edu</EM>, see also above). Response is often rapid.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="B_Are_there_configuration_f"><STRONG>[+]</STRONG> Are there configuration files for PDL I have to edit?

</A></H2>
Most users should not have to edit any configuration files manually.
However, in some cases you might have to supply some information about
akwardly placed include files/libraries or you might want to explicitly
disable building some of the optional PDL modules. Check the files INSTALL
and perldl.conf for details.


<P>

If you had to manually edit perldl.conf and are happy with the results you
can keep the file handy for future reference. Place it in ~/.perldl.conf
where it will be picked up automatically or use 
<CODE>perl Makefile.PL PDLCONF=your_file_name</CODE> next time you build PDL.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="B_Do_I_have_to_build_PDL_my"><STRONG>[+]</STRONG> Do I have to build PDL myself? Are there binary distributions?

There are no binary distributions at this time. As soon as the developers
find the time there will be binary distributions for some popular
platforms. Please check the PDL home site and the mailing list for
announcements.

<H2><A NAME="B_Do_I_need_other_software_"><STRONG>[+]</STRONG> Do I need other software for successfull operation?

</A></H2>
For the basic PDL functionality you don't need any additional software.
However, some of the optional PDL modules included in the distribution
(notably most graphics and some I/O modules) require certain other
libraries/programs to be installed. Check the file DEPENDENCIES in the
distribution for details and directions on how to get these.

Sometimes perldl is used as a synonym for PDL. Strictly speaking, however,
the name perldl is reserved for the little shell that comes with the PDL

PDL scripts. For details check the perldl man page.

See answer to the next question why the normal perl array syntax doesn't
work for pdls.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="The_docs_say_pdls_are_some_kind_">The docs say pdls are some kind of array. But why doesn't the perl array syntax work with pdls then ?

</A></H2>
Ok, you are right in a way. The docs say that pdls can be thought of
arrays. More specifically, it says (<EM>PDL/Impatient</EM>):


<P>

<PRE>  I find when using perlDL it is most useful to think of
  standard perl @x variables as &quot;lists&quot; of generic &quot;things&quot;
  and PDL variables like $x as &quot;arrays&quot; which can be contained
  in lists or hashes.
</PRE>

<P>

So, while pdls can be thought of as some kind of multi-dimensional array
they are <STRONG>not</STRONG> arrays in the perl sense. Rather, from the point of view of perl they are
some special class (which is currently implemented as an opaque pointer to
some stuff in memory) and therefore need special functions (or 'methods' if
you are using the OO version) to access individual elements or a range of
elements. The functions/methods to check are
<CODE>at</CODE>/<CODE>sec</CODE> (see <EM>PDL/Impatient</EM>) or the powerful <CODE>slice</CODE> function and friends (see <EM>PDL/Slices</EM> and 
<EM>PDL/Indexing</EM>).


<P>

Finally, to confuse you completely, you can have perl arrays of plds, e.g.
$spec[3] can refer to a pdl representing ,e.g, a spectrum, where $spec[3]
is the fourth element of the perl list (or array ;) <CODE>@spec</CODE>. This may be confusing but is very useful !


<P>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="What_on_earth_is_this_dataflow_s">What on earth is this dataflow stuff ?

</A></H2>
Dataflow is an experimental project that you don't need to concern yourself
with (it should not interfere with your usual programming). However, if you
want to know, have a look at <EM>PDL/Dataflow</EM>. There are applications which will benefit from this feature (and it is
already at work behind the scenes).

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="There_is_this_strange_pre_proces">There is this strange pre-processor package (PDL::PP). Do I have to know about it?

</A></H2>
PDL::PP is used to compile very concise definitions into XSUB routines
implemented in C that can easily be called from PDL and which automatically
support threading, dataflow and other things without you having to worry
about it.


<P>

For further details check <EM>PDL/PP</EM>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Sometimes_I_am_getting_these_str">Sometimes I am getting these strange results when using inplace operations ?

</A></H2>
This question is related to the <CODE>inplace</CODE> function. From the documentation (see <EM>PDL/Impatient</EM> manpage):


<P>

<PRE>   Most functions, e.g. log(), return a result which is
   a transformation of their argument. This makes for
   good programming practice. However many operations can
   be done &quot;in-place&quot; and this may be required when large
   arrays are in use and memory is at a premium. For these
   circumstances the operator inplace() is provided which
   prevents the extra copy and allows the argument to be
   modified. e.g.:
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>   $x = log($array);          # $array unaffected
   log( inplace($bigarray) ); # $bigarray changed in situ
</PRE>

<P>

And also from the doc !!:


<P>

<PRE>  Obviously when used with some functions which can
  not be applied in situ (e.g. convolve()) unexpected
  effects may occur!
</PRE>

<P>

Check the list of PDL functions at the end of PDL.pod which points out
<CODE>inplace</CODE>-safe functions.

See next question on assignment in PDL.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Why_are_there_two_different_kind">Why are there two different kinds of assignment in PDL ?

</A></H2>
This is caused by the fact that currently the assignment operator <CODE>=</CODE>
allows only restricted overloading. For some purposes of PDL (new indexing
features, dataflow) it turned out to be necessary to have more control over
the overloading of an assignment operator. Therefore, PDL peruses the
operator
<CODE>.=</CODE> for certain types of assignments. For details see the documentation about
indexing/threading and dataflow that come with those versions of PDL.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_happens_when_I_have_several">What happens when I have several references to the same PDL object in different variables (cloning, etc?) ?

</A></H2>
Piddles behave like perl references in many respects. So when you say


<P>

<PRE>   $a = pdl [0,1,2,3];
   $b = $a;
</PRE>

<P>

then both <CODE>$b</CODE> and <A HREF="#item__a">$a</A> point to the same
object, e.g. then saying


<P>

<PRE>   $b++;
</PRE>

<P>

will *not* create a copy of the original piddle but just increment in
place, of which you can convince yourself by saying


<P>

<PRE>   print $a;
[1 2 3 4]
</PRE>

<P>

This should not be mistaken for dataflow which connects several *different*
objects so that data changes are propagated between the so linked piddles
(though, under certain circumstances, dataflown piddles can share
physically the same data).


<P>

It is important to keep the ``reference nature'' of piddles in mind when
passing piddles into subroutines. If you modify the input pdls you modify
the original argument, <EM>not</EM> a copy of it. This is different from some other array processing languages
but makes for very efficient passing of piddles between subroutines. If you
do not want to modify the original argument but rather a copy of it just
create a copy explicitly (this example also demonstrates how to properly
check for an <EM>explicit</EM> request to process inplace, assuming your routine can work inplace):


<P>

<PRE>  sub myfunc {
     my $pdl = shift;
     if ($pdl-&gt;is_inplace)
        {$pdl-&gt;set_inplace(0)}
     else  # modify a copy by default
        {$pdl = $pdl-&gt;copy}
     $pdl-&gt;set(0,0);
     return $pdl;
  }
</PRE>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_I_O_formats_are_supported_b">What I/O formats are supported by PDL ?

</A></H2>
The current versions of PDL already support quite a number of different I/O
formats. However, it is not always obvious which module implements which
formats. To help you find the right module for the format you require, here
is a short list of the current list of I/O formats and a hint in which
module to find the implementation:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_raw">raw format

</A></STRONG><DD>
A home brew fast raw (binary) I/O format for PDL is implemented by the
FastRaw module


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_a">a more generic raw format

</A></STRONG><DD>
The FlexRaw module implements generic methods for the input and output of
`raw' data arrays. In particular, it is designed to read output from
FORTRAN 77 UNFORMATTED files and the low-level C write function, even if
the files are compressed or gzipped.


<P>

It is possible that the FastRaw functionality will be included in the
FlexRaw module at some time in the future.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_FITS">FITS

</A></STRONG><DD>
FITS I/O is implemented by the wfits/rfits functions in PDL::Io::Misc.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_ASCII">ASCII

</A></STRONG><DD>
Ascii file I/O in various formats can be achieved by using the <CODE>rcols</CODE>
and <CODE>rgrep</CODE> functions, also in PDL::Io::Misc.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_image">image formats (TIFF, GIF, JPEG, etc)

</A></STRONG><DD>
PDL::Io::Pic implements an interface to the netpbm/pbm+ filters to
read/write several popular image formats; also supported is output of image
sequences as MPEG movies.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_NetCDF">NetCDF

</A></STRONG><DD>
On CPAN you can find the PDL-NetCDF module that works with the current
released version of PDL 1.11. A new version for use with PDL 1.99 and
higher is in the making.


<P>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_is_a_C_null_pdl_">What is a <CODE>null</CODE> pdl ?

</A></H2>
<CODE>null</CODE> is a special token for 'empty piddle'. A null pdl can be used to flag to a
PDL function that it should create an appropriately sized and typed piddle. <EM>Null</EM> piddles can be used in places where a PDL function exspects an <EM>output</EM> or <EM>temporary</EM> argument. <EM>Output</EM>
and <EM>temporary</EM> arguments are flagged in the <EM>signature</EM> of a PDL function with the <CODE>[o]</CODE> and <CODE>[t]</CODE> qualifiers (see next question if you don't know what the <EM>signature</EM> of a PDL function is). For example, you can invoke the <CODE>sumover</CODE> function as follows:


<P>

<PRE>  sumover $a, $b=null;
</PRE>

<P>

which is equivalent to


<P>

<PRE>  $b = sumover $a;
</PRE>

<P>

If this seems still a bit murky check <EM>PDL:Indexing</EM> and <EM>PDL/PP</EM>
for details about calling conventions, the <EM>signature</EM> and
<EM>threading</EM> (see also below).


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_is_the_I_signature_of_a_PD">What is the <EM>signature</EM> of a PDL function ?

</A></H2>
The <EM>signature</EM> of a function is an important concept in PDL. Many (but not all) PDL
function have a <EM>signature</EM>
which specifies the arguments and their (minimal) dimensionality. As an
example, look at the signature of the <CODE>maximum</CODE>
function:


<P>

<PRE>  'a(n); [o] b;'
</PRE>

<P>

this says that <CODE>maximum</CODE> takes two arguments, the first of which is (at least) one-dimensional while
the second one is zero-dimensional and an <EM>output</EM> argument (flagged by the <CODE>[o]</CODE> qualifier). If the function is called with pdls of higher dimension the
function will be repeatedly called with slices of these pdls of appropriate
<CODE>dimension(this</CODE> is called <EM>threading</EM> in PDL).


<P>

For details and further explanations consult <EM>PDL/Indexing</EM> and
<EM>PDL/PP</EM>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="B_How_can_I_subclass_inher"><STRONG>[+]</STRONG> How can I subclass (inherit from) piddles?

</A></H2>
The short answer is: read <EM>PDL/Objects</EM> (e.g. type <CODE>help PDL::Objects</CODE> 
in the <EM>perldl</EM> shell).


<P>

The longer answer (extracted from <EM>PDL/Objects</EM>): Since a PDL object is an opaque reference to a C struct, it is not
possible to extend the PDL class by e.g. extra data via subclassing (as you
could do with a hash based perl object). To circumvent this problem PDL has
built-in support to extent the PDL class via the <EM>has-a</EM> relation for blessed hashes. You can get the <EM>HAS-A</EM> behave like <EM>IS-A</EM> simply in that you assign the PDL object to the attribute named <CODE>PDL</CODE> and redefine the method <CODE>initialize().</CODE> For example:


<P>

<PRE>   package FOO;
      
   @FOO::ISA = qw(PDL);
   sub initialize {
            my $class = shift;
            my $self = {
                    creation_time =&gt; time(),  # necessary extension :-)
                    PDL =&gt; PDL-&gt;null,         # used to store PDL object
                    };
            bless $self, $class;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

For another example check the script <EM>t/subclass.t</EM> in the PDL distribution.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="B_How_can_I_stack_a_set_of_"><STRONG>[+]</STRONG> How can I stack a set of 2D arrays (images) into a 3D piddle?

</A></H2>
Assuming all arrays are of the same size and in some format recognised by
rpic (see <EM>PDL/IO/Pic</EM>) you could say:


<P>

<PRE>  use PDL::Io::Pic;
  @names = qw/name1.tif .... nameN.tif/;  # some file names
  $dummy = PDL-&gt;rpic($names[0]);
  $cube = PDL-&gt;zeroes($dummy-&gt;type,$dummy-&gt;dims,$#names+1); # make 3D piddle
  for (0..$#names) 
    {($tmp = $cube-&gt;slice(&quot;:,:,($_)&quot;)) .= PDL-&gt;rpic($names[$_])}
</PRE>

<P>

The for loop reads the actual images into a temporary 2D piddle whose
values are then assigned (using the overloaded <CODE>.=</CODE> operator) to the approriate slices of the 3D piddle <CODE>$cube</CODE>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="B_Where_are_testfiles_for_t"><STRONG>[+]</STRONG> Where are testfiles for the graphics modules?

</A></H2>
This answer applies mainly to PDL::Graphics::TriD (PDL's device independent
3D graphics model) which is the trickiest one in this respect. You find
some test scripts in
<EM>Demos/TriD</EM> in the distribution. After you have built PDL just change to that directory
and try


<P>

<PRE>  perl -Mblib &lt;testfile&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

where <CODE>&lt;testfile&gt;</CODE> should match the pattern <CODE>test[0-9].p</CODE>
and watch the results. Some of the tests should bring up a window where you
can control (twiddle) the 3D objects with the mouse. Try using MB1 for
turning the objects in 3D space and MB3 to zoom in and out.


<P>

If you have a VRML viewer plugin for netscape you can also try tvrml*.p for
PDL generated dynamic VRML.


<P>

Some demos of 3D graphics with PDL can also be invoked using the <CODE>demo</CODE> command within the perldl shell.

<H2><A NAME="B_Oops_what_is_threading_"><STRONG>[!]</STRONG> Oops, what is threading (is PDL a newsreader) ?

</A></H2>
Unfortunately, in the context of PDL the term threading can have two
different (but related) meanings:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
When mentioned in the INSTALL directions and possible during the build
process we have the usual computer science meaning of multithreading in
mind (useful mainly on multiprocessor machines or clusters)


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
PDL threading of operations on piddles (as mentioned in the indexing docs)
is the iteration of a basic operation over appropriate subslices of
piddles, e.g. the inner product <CODE>inner $a, $b</CODE> of a (3) pdl <A HREF="#item__a">$a</A> and a (3,5,4) pdl <CODE>$b</CODE> results in a (5,4) piddle where each value is the result of an inner
product of the (3) pdl with a (3) subslice of the (3,5,4) piddle. For
details check <EM>PDL/Indexing</EM>.


<P>

</UL>
PDL threading leads naturally to potentially parallel code which can make
use of multithreading on multiprocessor machines/networks; there you have
the connection between the two types of use of the term.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_is_a_piddle_C_">What is a piddle <CODE>(;)</CODE> ?

</A></H2>
Well, PDL scalar variables (which are instances of a particular class of
perl objects, i.e. blessed thingies (see <EM>perlfaq</EM>)) are in common PDL parlance often called <EM>piddles</EM> (for example, check the mailing list archives). Err, clear? If not, simply
use the term
<EM>piddle</EM> when you refer to a PDL variable (an instance of a PDL object as you might
remember) regardless of what actual data the PDL variable contains.
