Perl is an extremely good and versatile scripting language, well suited to
beginners and allows rapid prototyping. However until recently it did not
support data structures which allowed it to do fast number crunching.


<P>

However with the development of Perl v5, Perl acquired 'Objects'. To put it
simply users can define their own special data types, and write custom
routines to manipulate them either in low level languages (C and Fortran)
or in Perl itself.


<P>

This has been fully exploited by the PerlDL developers. The 'PDL' module is
a complete Object-Oriented extension to Perl (although you don't have to
know what an object is to use it) which allows large N-dimensional data
sets, such as large images, spectra, time series, etc to be stored  <STRONG>efficiently</STRONG> and manipulated <STRONG>en masse</STRONG>. For example with the PDL module we can write the perl code <CODE>$a=$b+$c</CODE>, where <CODE>$b</CODE> and <CODE>$c</CODE> are large datasets (e.g.
2048x2048 images), and get the result in only a fraction of a second.


<P>

PDL variables (or 'piddles' as they have come to be known) support a wide
range of fundamental data types - arrays can be bytes, short integers
(signed or unsigned), long integers, floats or double precision floats. And
because of the Object-Oriented nature of PDL new customised datatypes can
be derived from them.  


<P>

As well as the PDL modules, that can be used by normal perl programs,
PerlDL comes with a command line perl shell, called 'perldl', which
supports command line editing. In combination with the various PDL graphics
modules this allows data to be easily played with and visualised.
