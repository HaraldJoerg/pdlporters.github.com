PDL::Philosophy -- what's behind PDL?


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
This is an attempt to summarize some of the common spirit between pdl
developers in order to answer the question ``Why PDL''? If you are a PDL
developer and I haven't caught your favorite ideas about PDL, please let me
know!


<P>

An often-asked question is: Why not settle for some of the existing systems
like Matlab or IDL or GnuPlot or whatever?


<P>

The first tenet of our philosophy is the ``free software'' idea: software
being free has several advantages (less bugs because more people see the
code, you can have the source and port it to your own working environment
with you, ... and of course, that you don't need to pay anything).


<P>

The second idea is a pet peeve of many: many languages like matlab are
pretty well suited for their specific tasks but for a different
application, you need to change to an entirely different tool and regear
yourself mentally. Not to speak about doing an application that does two
things at once... Because we use Perl, we have the power and ease of perl
syntax, regular expressions, hash tables etc at our fingertips at all
times. By extending an existing language, we start from a much healthier
base than languages like matlab which have grown into existence from a very
small functionality at first and expanded little by little, making things
look badly planned. We stand by the Perl sayings: ``simple things should be
simple but complicated things should be possible'' and ``There is more than
one way to do it'' (TIMTOWTDI).


<P>

The third idea is interoperability: we want to be able to use PDL to drive
as many tools as possible, we can connect to OpenGL or Mesa for graphics or
whatever. There isn't anything out there that's really satisfactory as a
tool and can do everything we want easily. And be portable.


<P>

The fourth idea is related to PDL::PP and is Tuomas's personal favorite:
code should only specify as little as possible redundant info. If you find
yourself writing very similar-looking code much of the time, all that code
could probably be generated by a simple perl script. The PDL C preprocessor
takes this to an extreme.

We want speed. Optimally, it should ultimately (e.g. with the Perl
compiler) be possible to compile PDL::PP subs to C and obtain the top
vectorized speeds on supercomputers. Also, we want to be able to calculate
things at near top speed from inside perl, by using dataflow to avoid
memory allocation and deallocation (the overhead should ultimately be only
a little over one indirect function call plus couple of ifs per function in
the pipe).


<P>

We want handy syntax. Want to do something and cannot do it easily? Tell us
about it...


<P>

We want lots of goodies. A good mathematical library etc.
