This still needs to be written properly.

There are basically two reasons for subclassing piddles. The first is
simply that you want to be able to use your own routines like 


<P>

<PRE>        $piddle-&gt;something()
</PRE>

<P>

but don't want to mess up the PDL namespace (a worthy goal, indeed!). The
other is that you wish to provide special handling of some functions or
more information about the data the piddle contains. In the first case, you
can do with


<P>

<PRE>        package BAR;
        @ISA=qw/PDL/;
        sub foo {my($this) = @_; fiddle;}
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        package main;
        $a = PDL::pdl(BAR,5);
        $a-&gt;foo();
</PRE>

<P>

However, because a PDL object is an opaque reference to a C struct, it is
not possible to extend the PDL class by e.g. extra data via subclassing. To
circumvent this problem PerlDL has built-in support to extent the PDL class
via the <EM>has-a</EM>
relation for blessed hashes. You can get the <EM>HAS-A</EM> behave like
<EM>IS-A</EM> simply in that you assign the <CODE>PDL</CODE> object to the attribute named PDL and redefine the method
<CODE>initialize().</CODE>


<P>

<PRE>    package FOO;
  
    @FOO::ISA = qw(PDL);
    sub initialize {
        my $class = shift;
        my $self = {
                creation_time =&gt; time(),  # necessary extension :-)
                PDL =&gt; null,             # used to store PDL object
                };
        bless $self, $class;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

All PDL constructor will call <CODE>initialize()</CODE> to make sure that
your extentions are added by <EM>all</EM> PDL constructors automaticly. The
<CODE>PDL</CODE> attribute is used by perlDL to store the PDL object and all PDL methods use
this attribute automaticly if they are called with a blessed hash reference
instead of a PDL object (a blessed scalar). Do remember that if you
subclass a class that is subclassed from a piddle, you need to call
SUPER::initialize.


<P>

NEED STUFF ABOUT CODE REFs!!
