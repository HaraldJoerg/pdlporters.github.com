<h1 class='title'>PDL Success Stories</h1>

<p>PDL is useful for manipulating many types of data, and has a very
diverse user community. Here are some interesting results obtained
with PDL by individuals and laboratories around the world.</p>

<h3 id="magnetic">Artificial vision of magnetic fields</h3>

<p>I and my graduate student use PDL to track thousands of magnetic features
on the Sun. The churning surface of the Sun is covered by magnetic north and
south poles that are constantly emerging, moving, recombining, and dissipating.
Special telescopes called <em><a href="http://soi.stanford.edu">magnetographs
</a></em> can view these poles as black and white spots, allowing us to probe
the Sun's dynamo. PDL's Transform package made it easy for us to remove
perspective effects from <a href="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov">spacecraft
data</a>, and to write an artificial vision application to identify
every magnetic feature in the field of view.</p>

<p>What's more, PDL is free -- so we can distribute
<a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/swamis">our software</a> for anyone to use.</p>

<h3 id="galaxy-gas">High speed galactic winds</h3>

<p>I did much of the data analysis for my Ph.D. thesis using PDL, and got an 
<a href="http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?Releases/2004/Jan04/r010604">
AAS press release</a> out of it. I never imagined being able to manipulate
3-D radio science datacubes in Perl until I met PDL. Thanks!</p>

<p>This optical image of the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) shows the regions
of high speed galactic winds that I discovered.</p>

<h3 id="glazebrook">Star Formation throughout the Universe</h3>

<p> As a professional astrophysicist, I have analyzed countless types of data
using PDL. Here is one example: In 1997 I collected some very deep-field
images of the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/hdf.html">Hubble
Deep Field</a> using the <a href="http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/jbh/ttf/">
Taurus Tunable Filter</a> and the 4m
<a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/Astronomy/telescopes/wht/">William Herschel
Telescope</a> in La Palma. The tunable filter produces 3-D data
(x,y,wavelength) that are difficult to analyze with conventional astronomical
software. I reduced my data entirely with home-brew PDL scripts that identified
galaxies and separated them by wavelength and position. The slicing, dicing,
rapid prototyping, and "glue" features of PDL and Perl were all used to the max.
</p>


<p> This figure is from a <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004AJ....128.2652G&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=425327f64719038">
paper</a> that I and some colleagues published in the <a
href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/">Astronomical
Journal</a>, showing emission line galaxies that we found in the data
cube (using another PDL script). Such galaxies have excess emission
at one wavelength due to nebular emission from young stars creating an
ionized nebula. Each row shows a single galaxy at several different
wavelengths, and the graph to the right shows the total brightness of
the galaxy at each wavelength. These galaxies are at distances of
5,000 - 10,000 million light years. We used these data to estimate the
formation rate of stars throughout much of the history of the Universe.

<p>One interesting fact: the original PDL script used to make this figure
(on a Sparc 20 workstation) in 1998 still worked unchanged (on a G5 Mac)
in 2004 when the final paper was submitted!</p>

<h3 id="ece">Measuring European air pollution for the U.N.</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The UN-ECE's <a href="www.emep.int">EMEP</a> program monitors
      long-range air pollutants such as acid rain and ozone, over the whole
      of Europe. The results are used to create international laws and
      accords such as the Gothenborg protocol. Our FORTRAN code models
      pollutant motion and chemistry throughout Europe, producing about
      50 GB of netcdf data for each year studied.</p>
    
      <p>Comparing these data with other data sources, extracting
      country-based data from the physical grid, and preparing statistics
      required a powerful, memory-efficient, flexible data language. PDL
      gave us exactly what we needed. We even used it to generate
      <a href="http://www.emep.int/reports/2004/Country_Reports">automated
      reports</a> for each of 50 countries.</p>

<table>

    <td>
      <p>At the <a href="http://www.latuv.uva.es">Remote Sensing Laboratory
      of the University of Valladolid</a>, we combine data from several
      satellites to produce real-time images of Spain and surroundings as a
      public service. Among other services, we can detect forest fires from
      satellite images within a few minutes, in time to alert regional
      authorities. Our pipeline includes 20 steps, some compiled in C and
      FORTRAN and others in Perl and Perl/PDL. Our results are published <a
      href="http://www.latuv.uva.es/modisql">on the web</a> and emailed to

<h3 id="brain">Visualization of my brain</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.jonaskaplan.com/tools.html">perlfMRI</a> is
a very simple tool I created for viewing functional MRI data, written
entirely in perl with PDL. What's nice about it is that it lets you
simultaneously view three planes through the brain and to rotate them
in 3d (see below). These images are showing my own brain, overlain
with activations in my auditory cortex while I listened to music.
They were created under MacOS X.</p>
