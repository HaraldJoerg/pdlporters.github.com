<h1 class='title'>How do I search for a function?</h1>

<p>Use the PerlDL shell on your computer. For example, use the <tt>help</tt>
command to learn about xvals:</p>

<pre>
perldl> help xvals
</pre>

<p>If you don't know the exact name of the function, use the <tt>apropos</tt>
command to do a fuzzy seach:</p>

<pre>
perldl> apropos xval
mn_init         The function mn_init() does the basic initialization of the
                fit. The first argument has to be a reference to the function
                to be minimized.
xlinvals        X axis values between endpoints (see xvals).
xlogvals        X axis values logarithmicly spaced between endpoints (see xvals).
xvals           Fills a piddle with X index values. Uses similar specifications
                to zeroes and new_from_specification.
yvals           Fills a piddle with Y index values. See the CAVEAT for xvals.
zvals           Fills a piddle with Z index values. See the CAVEAT for xvals.
</pre>

<p>The <tt>apropos</tt> command does a regex search for function names and
descriptions.</p>
