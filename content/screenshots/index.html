<h2>3D Graphics Examples</h2>

<p>Here are some pretty pictures generated using the
<tt>PDL::Graphics::TriD</tt> module, follow the links to get full-size
pictures and the PDL code which produced them.</p>

<p>Note when displayed with PDL viewing from different angles is as simple
as rotating the figure with the mouse!</p>

<h2> 2D &amp; 3D Graphics Examples </h2>

<p><a href="https://www.plplot.org">PLplot</a> is a scientific plotting
library for 2D and 3D graphics. PLplot has a rich API allowing fine control
of every aspects of the plots. The PDL binding for PLplot (in
<tt>PDL::Graphics::PLplot</tt>) comes in two flavors: a high-level,
object-oriented interface and a low-level interface which is very close to
the C API of the library. The demos distributed with PLplot have been
ported to the low-level interface and are available at the <a
href="https://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples.php">PLplot examples
area</a> (two examples are shown below).</p>

<h2>Image Distortion Example</h2>

<p>Image resampling and co-alignment is handled by the <tt>PDL::Transform</tt>
package. Here is an example of a nonlinear coordinate transformation
applied to an image of the space shuttle. The image is being rotated
in logarithmic azimuthal space. The transformation is continuous
everywhere except on a singular ray extending upward from the origin.
The <tt>PDL::Transform</tt> code includes optimized resampling to prevent
introducing artifacts into your data. You can tell that it's at work
by comparing the <a href="images/screenshots/sampled.mpg">sampled</a> and <a
href="images/screenshots/antialiased.mpg">anti-aliased</a> movies. <a
href="images/screenshots/transform-commands.txt">Here</a> is the brief script that
generated the frames.</p>
