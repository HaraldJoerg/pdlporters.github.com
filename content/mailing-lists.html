<h1 class='title'> PDL Mailing Lists</h1>

<p>Our mailing lists are the best way to get in touch with other
PDL users, or with the PDL developers. If you need help with a special
problem, or if you wish to contribute to PDL, please join!  We have
two mailing lists now recently being hosted at SourceForge:</p>

  <dt>Users list (<a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pdl-general">Subscribe</a>)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The "<b>pdl-general</b>" list is the best place to ask general user
      questions and is the primary means of support for the Perl Data Language.
      It also features non-technical discussions about PDL, announcements, etc.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>The "<b>pdl-devel</b>" list is where developers work
      on the internals of PDL.  Discussions often get quite technical.

    <p>The "<b>Git Commit</b>" list sends an announcement every time a
    change is committed to PDL's main git repository. Join this list if
    you'd like to be informed of every contribution to PDL. There is also
    an option for a daily digest.</p>
