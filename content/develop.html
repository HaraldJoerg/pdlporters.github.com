<h2 id="devel">Help with development</h2>

<p>For over 20 years, PDL development was hosted by SourceForge. With the release of PDL 2.019 in May 2018, development is now hosted at GitHub.  However, the project still uses a few items at SourceForge.</p>

<h2 id="hints">Hints for developers</h2>

<ol>
 <li>If you are not familiar with Git, there are many online
 resources, tutorials,
 and <a href="https://services.github.com/on-demand/resources/cheatsheets/">cheat
 sheets</a> from which to learn.</li>
 <li>
  <p>Before committing a change to the repository you should update</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <tt>MANIFEST</tt> (using <tt>make manifest</tt>),
         <tt>MANIFEST.SKIP</tt>, <tt>TODO</tt> files
         if applicable.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>Remember to include POD documentation for any functions you
   add to the distribution.</p>
   <ul>
     <li>See Basic/Core/Core.pm for an example of including POD
     documentation in .pm files.</li>
     <li>See Basic/Core/Primitive/Primitive.pd for an example of including
     POD documentation in PDL .pd files.</li>
     <li>Read the documentation in PDL::Doc for a detailed description of
     the PDL documentation conventions.</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>Make sure you add a test case in the 't' directory for any
   significant additional capability you add to the PDL
   package.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>Don't commit before you successfully built and passed <tt>make
   test</tt>.  Use Git branches and GitHub's Pull Requests to test
   your changes on a wide variety of platforms, Perl versions, and
   environment combinations before merging your changes into the
   master branch.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>Use branches for long-running projects. Git has
   excellent support for branching and merging. Use it!</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>Bugs reported on the list should be entered into the
   <a href="https://github.com/PDLPorters/pdl/issues">issue
   tracker</a> and bugs closed when a patch has been committed as a
   fix. (Primary responsibility for this task is the pumpking, but
   other devels should be able to help.)</p>
 </li>
</ol>
